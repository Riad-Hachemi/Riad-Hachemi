## About Me

I once debugged a production server using only interpretive dance and a half-written haiku. My code compiles, but only out of fear. I specialize in non-specialization and occasionally consult for companies that don’t exist yet. I work exclusively in dark mode and believe tabs vs spaces should be settled in hand-to-hand combat.

## Learning Goals

* Artisanal merge conflicts

* Emotionally-driven CI/CD pipelines
* How to explain my job to my grandma
* Once deleted `main` to save disk space. Would do it again.
